##Programs

These are my Golang programs. I put these programs as a collection of programs that i learned from reading some fundamentals. <br>

Python is my main programming language but i was planning on changing my main language to the highest difficulty.<br>

I already have been learning 3 years of programming with python so i want to go up and test my skills.<br>

I went with Golang because of the resources and the C++ like syntax.<br>

The programs that i upload are random with no maximum limit and will be uploading more with advancements per month<br>

These things are simple programs that will be useful in the future for making microservices.
