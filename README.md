# Golang_codes
This is my no framework Golang repository which i will store random programs.

will start posting in months of November

I use Golang because of its ease of use, great performance and strong security.

I aim on being a polyglot in IOT so having Golang as one of my C like languages will give me a boost

i picked Golang as a challenging Language
because the syntax is close to c++.

the challenging part is not the c++ like syntax but the strictness when saving the program.

the challenge to use every variable is a must to decrease the likeliness of bugs.

i remember in data science that every data is valuable so i will be using tons of 
dictionaries and formatted procedures to make the codes readable.
